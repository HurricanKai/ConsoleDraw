To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Goldenrod. 
The tones are extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of artistic theory most of the beauty will go over a typical painter's head.
There's also the flower's nihilistic style, which is deftly woven into its characterisation - it's pollinated by the Bombus cryptarum bumblebee, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depth of this flower, to realize that it's not just a color - it says something deep about LIFE.
As a consequence people who dislike Goldenrod truly ARE idiots - of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the beauty in the bumblebee species' complex presence in the British Isles, which is cryptically explained by Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons
I'm blushing right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as nature's genius unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools... how I pity them.
And yes by the way, I DO have a goldenrod tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.
